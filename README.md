==============

Code name for a in-house (Udacity) app to make
image macros/memes.

Partially a test for Polymer and Chrome Packaged Apps so there are
three included versions:

1) Simple one-page version with no frills that requires selecting an image from
your drive [https://github.com/jwill/flaming-batman/blob/master/meme-simple.html](https://github.com/jwill/flaming-batman/blob/master/meme-simple.html)
2) Polymer version with a Material UI and a pool of images to create
memes. (tag NonChrome App [https://github.com/jwill/flaming-batman/releases/tag/NonChromeApp](https://github.com/jwill/flaming-batman/releases/tag/NonChromeApp)
3) Offline-capable Polymer Chrome App has everything from #2 but uses Chrome APIs for
saving/loading, permissions to use storage and local file system.
